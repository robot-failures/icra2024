    <h4>Submission guidelines</h4>

    Submissions to the workshop can be up to 4 pages long using the <a href="https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php">IEEE conference template</a>.
    Submissions describing work in progress that authors would like to discuss with the workshop participants are particularly encouraged and welcome.
    The workshop does not have official proceedings, but the submitted papers will be posted on the workshop website if the authors agree.
    <br /><br />

    Paper submissions should be made via EasyChair.
    Please note that submissions via other means, such as email, will not be accepted.
    <br /><br />

    Each submitted paper will receive at least two reviews, based on which an acceptance decision will be made.
    <br /><br />

    Accepted papers will be presented in the form of spotlight presentations and during a poster session that will follow the spotlights.
