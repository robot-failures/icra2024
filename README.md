## Todo

 - Reference hoverboard: https://github.com/gdg-x/hoverboard
  
 - Make the site "mobile friendly", but open an issue where someone could make the site MORE mobile friendly. Be sure to post it in "up for grabs"

 - Clean up this README to add some details about how to contribute :) Also really make it clear that this is a SIMPEL HTML/CSS template.

 - Uupdate the sitemap

 - Open up any more issues that need opening???

 - Don't include MathJax, ... but tell users that they should include MathJAX :D
   I mean just use a CDN https://docs.mathjax.org/en/v2.7-latest/start.html
